HVACgooee — GUI v3
Phase C Activation Plan — Read-Only Wiring

Status: DRAFT (PAPER-ONLY)
Pre-condition: GUI v3 Phase B frozen
Goal: Introduce explicit, read-only data ingress into GUI panels without granting authority, reactivity, or mutation.

1. Meaning of Phase C (LOCK THIS)

Phase C enables panels to receive data, but never to request, compute, or mutate it.

Panels become observers, not participants.

Phase C is pull-only, invoked by the application lifecycle.

2. Phase Boundary (Very Important)
Layer	Phase B	Phase C
Panel	Static layout	Read-only setters
Adapter	Disabled	Enabled
Engines	Irrelevant	Still untouched
ProjectState	Read-only	Read-only
Signals	None	None

No signals yet.
No events.
No feedback loops.

3. Activation Order (MANDATORY)

Phase C must be activated in this order:

Panels gain read-only setters

Adapters are enabled

MainWindow lifecycle calls refresh

GUI verifies no mutation occurs

If you reverse this order, Phase C fails.

4. Panel Contract (STRICT)

Each Phase C panel:

MAY:

accept immutable DTOs

update labels, tables, text

show “not available” if data is missing

MUST NOT:

compute

validate

transform

persist

emit signals

infer missing data

REQUIRED:

setters must be explicitly named read-only

Naming rule (LOCKED):
set_*_readonly(...)


Examples:

set_environment_readonly(env_dto)

set_project_summary_readonly(summary_dto)

set_hydronics_snapshot_readonly(snapshot_dto) (later)

No generic set_data().

5. Adapter Contract (Phase C)

Adapters become the only bridge between:

ProjectState

Panels

Adapter responsibilities:

pull data from HVAC.project.
State

adapt to panel DTO shape

call read-only setters

Adapter restrictions:

no caching

no mutation

no calculations

no interpretation

Adapters are plumbing only.

6. MainWindow Lifecycle Changes
Phase C re-enables:
def refresh_project_panels(self) -> None:
    self._project_panel_adapter.refresh()
    self._environment_panel_adapter.refresh()
    self._education_panel_adapter.refresh()


But:

refresh is manual

refresh is single-shot

no auto-refresh on state change yet

7. Data Sources (Locked for Phase C)

Adapters may only read from:

ProjectState (authoritative intent)

pre-computed result DTOs (if already present)

Adapters must not trigger:

heat-loss

hydronics

environment resolution

If data is missing:

panel shows “Not run”

adapter returns silently

8. Phase C Panel Inventory
Panel	Phase C Scope
Project Panel	metadata only
Environment Panel	temperatures, design assumptions
Education Panel	static text only
System Summary	flags only
Hydronics Schematic	still Phase B (NO data yet)

⚠ Hydronics Schematic does not activate in Phase C
It waits for Phase D+.

9. Definition of DONE (Phase C)

Phase C is complete when:

panels populate from HVAC.project.
State

no panel can mutate state

no adapter imports engines

GUI survives refresh calls

removing adapters breaks nothing

log output remains silent

If anything reacts, Phase C is violated.

10. Explicit Non-Goals (Write This Down)

Phase C does not include:

signals

observers

live updates

recalculation triggers

editing widgets

topology wiring

schematic drawing

All of that is Phase D+.

11. Freeze Statement (Recommended)

GUI v3 Phase C enables read-only data flow into panels via adapters.
Panels remain non-authoritative observers.

12. Resume Marker

When you stop:

“GUI v3 Phase C activation plan drafted; no code started.”

That gets you back instantly.

Why This Plan Is Strong

It matches your Phase B discipline

It prevents accidental “half-reactive” GUIs

It keeps hydronics schematic isolated

It makes Phase D a choice, not a slide

You’ve built a proper GUI lifecycle, not just screens.
