Freeze: Hydronics Schematic — Phase A (Node DTOs)

Phase A defines the authoritative hydronic topology model.
Only nodes and logical connections are declared.
No flow, sizing, pressure, or calculation logic is included.

This phase establishes the immutable structural graph
upon which all later hydronic engines operate.

LOCKED.

4️⃣ Explicit Phase A rules (write this in the doc)

Phase A forbids:

Geometry (x/y/z)

Qt imports

ProjectState

Engines

Validation

“Convenience” helpers

Phase A guarantees:

Stable contracts

Renderer independence

2D → 3D upgrade path

Zero GUI bleed into physics

5️⃣ Freeze statement (add to your bootstrap)

Freeze: Hydronics Schematic — Phase A (Node DTOs only)

This freeze locks:

Node vs connector semantics

Graph-based topology model

Immutable, read-only DTO contracts

Any change requires a new Phase A bootstrap.

6️⃣ What comes after this (don’t do yet)

Only after Phase A is frozen do we proceed to:

Phase B → already done (static layout ✅)

Phase C → read-only setters on panel

Phase D → adapter builds HydronicSchematicGraphDTO

Phase E → refresh + navigation
The schematic panel now accepts a HydronicSchematicGraphDTO via a one-way adapter.
No rendering, interaction, or authority is introduced.
This establishes the data contract boundary between hydronics topology and GUI.

7️⃣ Next thin slices (pick ONE later)

🔹 Phase D: render nodes as simple labels

🔹 Phase D-alt: graph inspector (text/debug)

🔹 Phase C.1: multiple dummy graphs

🔹 Phase A.1: edge direction semantics
