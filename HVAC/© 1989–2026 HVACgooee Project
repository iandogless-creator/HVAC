Engineering Lineage

HVACgooee is not a greenfield engineering project.

The core hydronic sizing and flow logic implemented in HVACgooee traces back
to engineering methods developed in the late 1980s, including early
ZX Spectrum-era BASIC implementations and later SC4 / SC5.

The original code from that era no longer exists. However, the underlying
algorithms and engineering intent were continuously preserved through
successive re-implementations across later BASIC dialects, Delphi-based
applications, and spreadsheet-based workflows used in professional practice.

HVACgooee represents a modern, open-source re-expression of this lineage,
retaining the original engineering logic while updating the physics,
numerical methods, and software architecture to contemporary standards.
